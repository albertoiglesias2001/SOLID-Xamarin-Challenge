# SOLID-Xamarin-Challenge

## Fizz Buzz Technical
Challenge

### Brief

This challenge is to assess your abilities to create a cross
platform application, using Agile best practices and software engineering best
practices. You must not only fulfil the functional requirements but also
technical non-functional requirements.

### **The Functional Requirements**

Please build a Xamarin App that can be deployed on Android
or iOS:

So, that when a user enters a number

Then a response will be given back to the user, on meeting the following condition:

If the entered number is a multiple of 3 there will be a response of Fizz.

If the entered number is a multiple of 5 there will be a response of Buzz.

Else return nothing.

### The Non-Functional Requirements

The layout of the application is not important. We will be
assessing your solution on how well it follows Xamarin best practices, Software
development best practices, Test Driven Best Practices and Source Control Best Practicesâ€¢.
We will be looking to see you implement SOLID Principles, Software Design
Patterns amongst other best practices.
